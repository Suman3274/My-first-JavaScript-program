# My-first-JavaScript-program
So this is basically a tic-tac-toe game written in JavaScript. This is my very first project/game in the world of JavaScript. Really excited to share this code on the  GitHub community. I just coded this game after learning some concepts of JavaScript, like Event Listeners, loops, conditionals, if-else statements, and many more.
